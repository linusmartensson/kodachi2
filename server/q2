The website is layouted as such:
Our workspace contains information about who is using the workspace, a toolbox for manipulating the workspace, a drawer, and a set of items on the workspace:

* Workspace
 - Profile
 - Toolbox
 - Drawer
 - Item
 - Item
 - Item


The toolboxes contain a set of statements, indicating things we can do:
 - Write an article
 - Create an event
 - Join a crew group
 - Buy a ticket
 - Edit our profile

The drawer contains one or more items that can be placed on the workspace:
 - News archive
 - User list
 - List of Crew groups

Items may be: 
 - Frequently asked questions
 - Gallery of events
 - List of outstanding tasks
 - Schedules
 - Recent news

Additionally, a single item may contain more items:
 - FAQ questions
 - Crew group members
 - List of crew groups

Additionally, each item may have tools:
 - Delete user from crew
 - Edit user
 - Edit article
 - Add FAQ item
 - Edit FAQ item

Drawer items with important information or tasks are opened when the page is loaded.

When a drawer item is opened, the item is placed at the top of the workspace.
Any item on the workspace may be put back into the drawer.

The profile is also a drawer item, which contains a set of statements, describing the responsibilities,
capabilities and achievements of the current user:
 - Current roles
 - Previous assignments
 - Achieved tasks
 - Personal user information
 - A main role and a level in that role.

Visiting a path is equivalent to viewing an item in the workspace:
/news/article-on-pizza/editor
/users/timmeh

All state mutation is done through socket.io and does not have fixed paths.
